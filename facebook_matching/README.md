To train a model, please run ```src/train.py``` with a config file as flag:
```
python train.py --config config1
```

You need to adjust data paths and other parameters in respective config file to make it work.

The blending and ranking procedure is detailed in ```notebooks/blend_ranking.ipynb```.
